Station: holds a set of stock items (which are specific to the station)

CustomerOrder: list of items that need to be filled

WorkStation: processes queue of orders by filling the next order in the queue, if that order requests the stationâ€™s item and the item is in stock

Line manager: keeps moving CustomerOrder from Station to Station until all orders have been processed

Any station that has used all the items cannot fill anymore orders

At the end of the line, orders are either completed or incomplete due to lack of inventory at one or more stations.
